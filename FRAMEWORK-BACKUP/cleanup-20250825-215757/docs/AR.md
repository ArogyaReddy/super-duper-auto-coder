## 1. No time - no worry. Spend 1 minute for a story and AI does the job in 5 minutes

- When we have lotâ€™s of stories..
- When we have lotâ€™s of features/ functionalities ..
- When we donâ€™t have time..
- When we can spend 1 minute for a story, for a feature
- Framework uses AI/Agent to generate test artifacts, that are 100% matching and compatible with SBS_Automation
- 80% to 90% are ready with automation, except the locators.
- Locators can be added/updated when the UI is ready and feature is functional

## 2. Have time - Good. Spend 5 minute for a story and NO - AI is needed., Job is done in 5 minutes

- When we have lotâ€™s of stories..
- When we have lotâ€™s of features / functionalities ..
- When we spend some time..
- When we can spend 5 minute for a story, for a feature
- Framework uses code logic, and NO-AI [NO Agent] to generate test artifacts, that are 100% matching and compatible with SBS_Automation
- 60% to 80% are ready with automation, except the locators.
- Locators can be added/updated when the UI is ready and feature is functional
