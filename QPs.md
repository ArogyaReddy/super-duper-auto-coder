/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/my-cashflow-menu-page.js

### First of all : Big issue and most concerned fact is : Page file

#### 1. methods

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/my-cashflow-menu-page.js
The page file has no meaningful methods and not usable at all.
It has two dummy methods, which would never work and not implemented at all.
await this.waitForPageLoad();
await this.performGenericAction();

**Suggestion** :
since we are referencing and using the following base-page and By, we could make use of the existing methods in these classes to implement the required functionality in our page files.

const By = require("../../../SBS_Automation/support/By.js");
const BasePage = require("../../../SBS_Automation/pages/common/base-page");

#### 2. locators

page file has dummy locators and not usable at all.
We did not mention any meaningful locators in the page file as per feature file requirements.

feature file : /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/features/my-cashflow-menu.feature

// Page locators that we defined
const PAGE_HEADER = By.xpath("//h1 | //h2");
const MAIN_BUTTON = By.xpath("//button[@data-test-id='main-action']");
const CONTENT_AREA = By.xpath("//div[@data-test-id='content']");

**Suggestion** :
Actuallty, we could make use of the feature file, scenarios, steps and we can define and mention the locators in our page file.

Example :
featture file :
@smoke @regression
Scenario: CFC - Core RUN Menu
Given I logged into RUN
When I click on CashFlow Central menu on leftNav
Then Cashflow central promo page is loaded
And I should be able to click on "Learn More" and able to see IPM content on "Learn More" page.

@smoke @regression
Scenario: CFC - Core RUN Menu - Learn More
Given I am on the Cashflow central promo page
When I click on "Learn More"
Then I should be able to see IPM content on "Learn More" page
And I should be able to see the "Get Started" button.

We could have used locators for:
CashFlow Central menu
Cashflow central promo page
"Learn More" link
IPM content
"Get Started" button
and so...
that would cover all the elements on the page and it looks more organized and meaningful.

Let's start with the these actionable items in page file, by implementing the locators and methods accordingly, properly in our auto-coder framework.

Note, these test artifacts are generated using the Non-AI approach with the 5. ðŸŽ¯ Template-Driven Generation (Claude Quality) using interactive CLI

# Please fix the mentioned issues in our auto-coder framework.

=============================

How are we generating these test artifacts?
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/features/my-test.feature
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/my-test-page.js
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/steps/my-test-steps.js

==============

### steps file [ generated by framework]

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/steps/my-test-steps.js

What is this line?
Why are we doing like this?
is this correct?
myTestPage = myTestPage || new MyTestPage(this.page);

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/how-to/how-test-artifacts-generated .md

Are we following any patterns, process, rules, examples to generate test artifacts from auto-coder framework.

Because, we are not doing correct and I need fix each time..
in order to make it more effective...I suggest on the following..

1. Let's read through and understand our main SBS_Automation framework.
2. Grab an excellet feature file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
3. Grab an excellet steps file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
4. Grab an excellet page file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
5. Let's keep them as reference in our auto-coder framework {let's say in folder : auto-coder/examples}
6. Use that as base reference and let's exactly do the same, matching naming conventions, patterns, rules, process, implementations for our test artifacts, such as feature file, steps file, page file.
7. Make this is mandatory to auto-coder framework [with-in the code] to follow, use, implement and generate test artifacts

==============


/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples/README.md

This is good.
But how do I know our auto-coder framework will follow these?
is the auto-coder framework [for template driven generation and and others] updated to use these references?
Can you show me that?
are we sure, no more issues and we are all ways good with test artifacts generation.


=================

So, after your fixes and changes, 
I just ran the auto-coder framework...and I see CRITICAL issues.

Please refer below files
steps file:
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/steps/test-again-steps.js
page file:
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/test-again-page.js

the methods defined in steps file are not defined/implemented in page file..
It's a CRITICAL bug..
Why did we miss this?
How did we miss this?
What's causing this issue?
Did we not follow the process, implementation, examples?
What's causing the issue?

I need answer first, before fixing the framework?


============
Please refer : /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/test-again-page.js

Another critical issues :
1.
The page file has 16 methods but all the methods have the same 2 methods/implementations inside of 16 methods.
it's totally a WRONG and very vague generation.

   await this.waitForPageToLoad();
    await this.waitForLocator(this.pageHeader);

2. 
it has just 3 locators.

But the feature file has many feature steps
And steps file has many methods

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/features/test-again.feature
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/steps/test-again-steps.js

   // Page locators
    this.pageHeader = '[data-testid="page-header"]';
    this.mainContent = '[data-testid="main-content"]';
    this.primaryButton = '[data-testid="primary-button"]';

So, we are litterally missing or failing to add loctors.
THis is another vague implementation and WRONG.

How can we fix these two issues?

Based on feature file [steps] and steps file [methods] - can we logically refresent locators??



===========


LIKE the way, we implemented references from folder : /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples

Can we also do the simillar during AI based test artifacts generation too?
So that we dont make any issues and we follw the best practices and rules and patterns?
What do you say?

Also, I noticed two variations on the page file..
1 - this is part of main SBS_Automation
2 - this is that you used as reference.

Lot's of difference btween these two..
I am wondering on the 2. How did you get that? which is not really part of main SBS_Automation.
Also the lcoators are differerntly mentioned on the 2 [you used as refernce page file]

1. 
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/SBS_Automation/pages/common/home-page.js
2. /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples/REFERENCE-page-home-page.js

are we following or NOT?

So, again review the main SBS_Automation framework 

1. Let's read through and understand our main SBS_Automation framework.
2. Grab an excellet feature file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
3. Grab an excellet steps file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
4. Grab an excellet page file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
5. Let's keep them as reference in our auto-coder framework {let's say in folder : auto-coder/examples}
6. Use that as base reference and let's exactly do the same, matching naming conventions, patterns, rules, process, implementations for our test artifacts, such as feature file, steps file, page file.
7. Make this is mandatory to auto-coder framework [with-in the code] to follow, use, implement and generate test artifacts

Let's use it for our both AI generated and auto-coder framework generated
