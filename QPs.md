/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/my-cashflow-menu-page.js

### First of all : Big issue and most concerned fact is : Page file

#### 1. methods

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/my-cashflow-menu-page.js
The page file has no meaningful methods and not usable at all.
It has two dummy methods, which would never work and not implemented at all.
await this.waitForPageLoad();
await this.performGenericAction();

**Suggestion** :
since we are referencing and using the following base-page and By, we could make use of the existing methods in these classes to implement the required functionality in our page files.

const By = require("../../../SBS_Automation/support/By.js");
const BasePage = require("../../../SBS_Automation/pages/common/base-page");

#### 2. locators

page file has dummy locators and not usable at all.
We did not mention any meaningful locators in the page file as per feature file requirements.

feature file : /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/features/my-cashflow-menu.feature

// Page locators that we defined
const PAGE_HEADER = By.xpath("//h1 | //h2");
const MAIN_BUTTON = By.xpath("//button[@data-test-id='main-action']");
const CONTENT_AREA = By.xpath("//div[@data-test-id='content']");

**Suggestion** :
Actuallty, we could make use of the feature file, scenarios, steps and we can define and mention the locators in our page file.

Example :
featture file :
@smoke @regression
Scenario: CFC - Core RUN Menu
Given I logged into RUN
When I click on CashFlow Central menu on leftNav
Then Cashflow central promo page is loaded
And I should be able to click on "Learn More" and able to see IPM content on "Learn More" page.

@smoke @regression
Scenario: CFC - Core RUN Menu - Learn More
Given I am on the Cashflow central promo page
When I click on "Learn More"
Then I should be able to see IPM content on "Learn More" page
And I should be able to see the "Get Started" button.

We could have used locators for:
CashFlow Central menu
Cashflow central promo page
"Learn More" link
IPM content
"Get Started" button
and so...
that would cover all the elements on the page and it looks more organized and meaningful.

Let's start with the these actionable items in page file, by implementing the locators and methods accordingly, properly in our auto-coder framework.

Note, these test artifacts are generated using the Non-AI approach with the 5. ðŸŽ¯ Template-Driven Generation (Claude Quality) using interactive CLI

# Please fix the mentioned issues in our auto-coder framework.

=============================

How are we generating these test artifacts?

==============

### steps file [ generated by framework]

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/steps/my-test-steps.js

What is this line?
Why are we doing like this?
is this correct?
myTestPage = myTestPage || new MyTestPage(this.page);

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/how-to/how-test-artifacts-generated .md

Are we following any patterns, process, rules, examples to generate test artifacts from auto-coder framework.

Because, we are not doing correct and I need fix each time..
in order to make it more effective...I suggest on the following..

1. Let's read through and understand our main SBS_Automation framework.
2. Grab an excellet feature file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
3. Grab an excellet steps file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
4. Grab an excellet page file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
5. Let's keep them as reference in our auto-coder framework {let's say in folder : auto-coder/examples}
6. Use that as base reference and let's exactly do the same, matching naming conventions, patterns, rules, process, implementations for our test artifacts, such as feature file, steps file, page file.
7. Make this is mandatory to auto-coder framework [with-in the code] to follow, use, implement and generate test artifacts

==============


/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples/README.md

This is good.
But how do I know our auto-coder framework will follow these?
is the auto-coder framework [for template driven generation and and others] updated to use these references?
Can you show me that?
are we sure, no more issues and we are all ways good with test artifacts generation.


=================

So, after your fixes and changes, 
I just ran the auto-coder framework...and I see CRITICAL issues.

Please refer below files
steps file:
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/steps/test-again-steps.js
page file:
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/test-again-page.js

the methods defined in steps file are not defined/implemented in page file..
It's a CRITICAL bug..
Why did we miss this?
How did we miss this?
What's causing this issue?
Did we not follow the process, implementation, examples?
What's causing the issue?

I need answer first, before fixing the framework?


============
Please refer : /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/test-again-page.js

Another critical issues :
1.
The page file has 16 methods but all the methods have the same 2 methods/implementations inside of 16 methods.
it's totally a WRONG and very vague generation.

   await this.waitForPageToLoad();
    await this.waitForLocator(this.pageHeader);

2. 
it has just 3 locators.

But the feature file has many feature steps
And steps file has many methods

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/features/test-again.feature
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/steps/test-again-steps.js

   // Page locators
    this.pageHeader = '[data-testid="page-header"]';
    this.mainContent = '[data-testid="main-content"]';
    this.primaryButton = '[data-testid="primary-button"]';

So, we are litterally missing or failing to add loctors.
THis is another vague implementation and WRONG.

How can we fix these two issues?

Based on feature file [steps] and steps file [methods] - can we logically refresent locators??



===========


LIKE the way, we implemented references from folder : /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples

Can we also do the simillar during AI based test artifacts generation too?
So that we dont make any issues and we follw the best practices and rules and patterns?
What do you say?

Also, I noticed two variations on the page file..
1 - this is part of main SBS_Automation
2 - this is that you used as reference.

Lot's of difference btween these two..
I am wondering on the 2. How did you get that? which is not really part of main SBS_Automation.
Also the lcoators are differerntly mentioned on the 2 [you used as refernce page file]

1. 
/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/SBS_Automation/pages/common/home-page.js
2. /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/examples/REFERENCE-page-home-page.js

are we following or NOT?

So, again review the main SBS_Automation framework 

1. Let's read through and understand our main SBS_Automation framework.
2. Grab an excellet feature file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
3. Grab an excellet steps file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
4. Grab an excellet page file [any, but good that helps us to follow it all the times]
5. Let's keep them as reference in our auto-coder framework {let's say in folder : auto-coder/examples}
6. Use that as base reference and let's exactly do the same, matching naming conventions, patterns, rules, process, implementations for our test artifacts, such as feature file, steps file, page file.
7. Make this is mandatory to auto-coder framework [with-in the code] to follow, use, implement and generate test artifacts

Let's use it for our both AI generated and auto-coder framework generated


==========


We are using too much of "ADP" and "SBS" words everywhere - please avoid this.our auto-coder framework is common and generic to any testing, any app, any test files to test artifacts generations.
And for the reports, if we run more than once, the reports and report names are same and old ones will be replaced [because of same name].
Instead can we follow a different strategy please.
Examples :
for excel reports : BrokenLinks_Testing_Report_YYMMDDHHMMSS[AM/PM].xlsx
for other reports : 01_Summary_Dashboard_YYMMDDHHMMSS[AM/PM].csv
02_All_Links_Catalog_YYMMDDHHMMSS[AM/PM].csv
03_Menu_Navigation_YYMMDDHHMMSS[AM/PM].csv
04_Broken_Links_Details_YYMMDDHHMMSS[AM/PM].csv
05_Test_Results_YYMMDDHHMMSS[AM/PM].csv
06_Recommendations_YYMMDDHHMMSS[AM/PM].csv

And so on.
So that we have all the tests and reuslts to view and compare if needed.

For any of util tests/executions - if we need results and reprots to be published - please do so and use the simmilar style/pattern.
Note : we have 10 different utilities that we did and implemeted for ultimate testing purpose.



===============
For all our wronderful utilities, in order to make these utils best at use...
we have a much more comprehensive approach to handling different login scenarios.
I am not sure, how you are logging into my APP [ADP]
because there are different types of logins, different types of roles and different types of login URLs.
Examples : 
1. We have different environments
2. clients will have a different login URLs for RUN, MAX, DTO, WFN and so on.
3. internal users [service users] will have a different login URLs

So, how do we solve this problem.

I have a solution in mind that involves creating a universal authentication handler that can adapt to different login scenarios based on the user type and environment.
Two different login URLs will be supported:
1. For clients
2. For internal users [service users]
3. three different environments [QAFIT, IAT, PROD]

So, if you read through main SBS_Automation framework, you will see that it has a well-defined structure for handling different login scenarios.

Here are my thoughts and approach:
1. Create a universal authentication handler that can adapt to different login scenarios based on the user type and environment and test data.
2. Implement the necessary logic to switch between different login URLs for clients and internal users.
3. Ensure that the handler can seamlessly work across the three different environments [QAFIT, IAT, PROD].
4. Integrate this handler into our utilities to ensure consistent and reliable authentication across all testing scenarios and it should be independent of the utilities and any utility or framework-specific code can use when needed.


To achieve this, we will follow a structured approach to implement the universal authentication handler within our existing framework.
1. Read through main SBS_Automation framework to understand the current login handling mechanisms.
2. Extract different user roles, environments, and login URLs from the framework.
3. Extract relevant test data associated with each login scenario.
4. Extract the necessary authentication logic and implement it within the universal authentication handler.
5. Extract any utility functions or helper methods related to authentication and incorporate them into the handler.
6. Test the universal authentication handler across different login scenarios to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.
7. Document the implementation details and usage guidelines for the universal authentication handler to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.
8. We can also consider implementing logging and monitoring capabilities within the handler to track authentication attempts and identify potential issues.
9. Finally, we will review and refactor the existing utilities to ensure they leverage the universal authentication handler for all login-related operations.
10. Implement this within our automation framework to ensure all utilities can utilize the universal authentication handler seamlessly.
11. Add these functional approach and usage into our auto-coder framework - interactive CLI as Utils at Best [as main options]
12. And list all of the 10 utilities that will leverage the universal authentication handler as sub-commands in the interactive CLI.
13. during the implementation, we should ensure to gran user type [CLIENT or SERVICE USER] so that the universal authentication handler is easily configurable and can be extended to accommodate future login scenarios and requirements.
