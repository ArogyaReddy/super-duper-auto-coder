### First of all : Big issue and most concerned fact is : Page file

#### 1. methods

/Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/pages/my-cashflow-menu-page.js
The page file has no meaningful methods and not usable at all.
It has two dummy methods, which would never work and not implemented at all.
await this.waitForPageLoad();
await this.performGenericAction();

**Suggestion** :
since we are referencing and using the following base-page and By, we could make use of the existing methods in these classes to implement the required functionality in our page files.

const By = require("../../../SBS_Automation/support/By.js");
const BasePage = require("../../../SBS_Automation/pages/common/base-page");

#### 2. locators

page file has dummy locators and not usable at all.
We did not mention any meaningful locators in the page file as per feature file requirements.

feature file : /Users/arog/auto/auto/qa_automation/auto-coder/SBS_Automation/features/my-cashflow-menu.feature

// Page locators that we defined
const PAGE_HEADER = By.xpath("//h1 | //h2");
const MAIN_BUTTON = By.xpath("//button[@data-test-id='main-action']");
const CONTENT_AREA = By.xpath("//div[@data-test-id='content']");

**Suggestion** :
Actuallty, we could make use of the feature file, scenarios, steps and we can define and mention the locators in our page file.

Example :
featture file :
@smoke @regression
Scenario: CFC - Core RUN Menu
Given I logged into RUN
When I click on CashFlow Central menu on leftNav
Then Cashflow central promo page is loaded
And I should be able to click on "Learn More" and able to see IPM content on "Learn More" page.

@smoke @regression
Scenario: CFC - Core RUN Menu - Learn More
Given I am on the Cashflow central promo page
When I click on "Learn More"
Then I should be able to see IPM content on "Learn More" page
And I should be able to see the "Get Started" button.

We could have used locators for:
CashFlow Central menu
Cashflow central promo page
"Learn More" link
IPM content
"Get Started" button
and so...
that would cover all the elements on the page and it looks more organized and meaningful.

Let's start with the these actionable items in page file, by implementing the locators and methods accordingly, properly in our auto-coder framework.
