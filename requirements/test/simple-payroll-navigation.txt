Test Requirement: Payroll Navigation Validation

As a user, I need to navigate to the Payroll section and verify its main components are displayed correctly.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User logs into the system successfully
2. User navigates to the Payroll section using menu navigation
3. User verifies that the Payroll dashboard is displayed
4. User verifies that key payroll components are visible:
   - Employee list
   - Payroll summary
   - Process payroll button
5. User can interact with payroll elements

Business Context:
This test ensures that users can access payroll functionality through the standard navigation flow, verifying that all essential payroll components are properly loaded and accessible.

Expected Behavior:
- Login should use existing authentication workflow
- Navigation should use menu-based navigation (not URL navigation)
- All payroll elements should be visible and interactive
- Test should follow SBS_Automation patterns and reuse existing steps where possible
