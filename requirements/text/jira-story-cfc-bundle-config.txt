As a RUN client 
I want to have the ability to access CashFlow Central (CFC)
So that i can benefit from the services offered by them and streamline my financial operations

Tech: Create a new component for CFC that will be available for the below bundles. The component will default to be off and will be available through the features and overviews page and can be turned on and off via that page. Use a RUN property to drive making this available.
